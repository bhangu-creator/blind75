Two Pointer Apporach :

This approach will not work if the array is "sorted". Use "Merge sort" to sort the array first.

Idea of approach :

- There will be 2 pointers. One will start from left at 0 and other from right n-1
- Then add these two nums[0]+nums[n-1]. Now if output is bigger than the target than obviously this means that we have to reduce
the big part of our sum so this means that we should move the right pointer to left, it will get rid of the big part of sum
- If the sum is less that the target then simply increase the left pointer to right it will increase the sum.
- At the end you will find your sum
