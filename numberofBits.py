#this problem can be solved very easily using bitwise operators like & and >>
#what we are doing is basically checking the LSB(least significant bit) of a number n and if it is 1 then increasing the count
#then after that we are using >> to shift the bits right side which get rid of LSB giving us a new bit to verify

    #brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm:
    #First Observation is this if n is the number then in the binary form of n-1 all the bits will be opposite to n after the Right Set Bit
    #for example if n=10 binary= 1010 and n-1=9 binary 1001 then as noticed all bits after RSB are opposite in n-1 so we did this
    # n&(n-1) all the bits after RSB will become 0 
    #this algo is bettter as it only run as many times as there are set bits in a binary number and it will keep on making bits 0 after RSB ending the program when binary is 000
